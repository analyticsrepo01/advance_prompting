    "Details about the project: [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14GPoh6UYXgi-7PPAXPwS5hii63phzs6BlKiu-6QnmMQ/edit?resourcekey=0-DEPXV6CQflQuJAHSa38efQ)\n",

    "Use case problem\n",
    "Planning a trip can be a daunting task, especially if you're trying to do it for a large group of people. There are so many things to keep track of, from flights and hotels to activities and transportation. It's easy to forget something important or make a mistake that could ruin your trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use case solution\n",
    "Our trip itinerary planner solves this problem by providing a simple, easy-to-use interface for planning your trip. You can enter all of the important details, such as your travel days, budget, and interests, and the planner will generate a personalized itinerary for you considering your budget. The itinerary will include everything you need to know, from where to stay to what to do each day.\n",

    "Experiments using Vertex AI SDK for Python in Colab\n",

    "Prompt Design\n",
    "Below prompts have been used to get responses from LLM.\n",

    "Don't give incomplete sentences.\n",
    "Don't give long descriptions\n",

    "- Prepare Itinerary for {number_of_people} people traveling to {trip_destination} for {trip_days} days.\n",
    "- Consider {trip_price_category} {currency} budget for the complete trip.\n",
    "- Include the cost of each activity in the itinerary.\n",
    "- Include a link to the photos for each day.\n",
    "- Exclude information about tourist places.\n",

    "Risks\n",
